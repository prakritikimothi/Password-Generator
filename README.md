Analog Clock
Overview
This project is an Analog Clock created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock is designed to be simple yet elegant, showcasing the current time with smooth, real-time updates. This project is a great example of how to use JavaScript to dynamically update content and CSS for styling and animations.

Features
Real-Time Updates: The clock hands move smoothly to reflect the current time, updating every second.
Responsive Design: The clock is designed to be responsive and can be viewed on devices of various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile phones.
Elegant UI: A minimalistic and visually appealing design, using CSS for smooth animations and transitions.
Customizable: Easily modify the clockâ€™s appearance by adjusting the CSS.

Usage
Viewing the Clock: Simply open the index.html file in your browser, and the clock will display the current time.
Customizing the Appearance: Modify the style.css file to change the size, colors, and overall design of the clock.
Project Structure
The project is organized into three main files:

index.html - Contains the structure of the clock.
style.css - Contains the styles and animations for the clock.
script.js - Contains the logic to update the clock hands in real-time based on the current time.
How It Works
HTML: Defines the structure of the clock, including the clock face and hands.
CSS: Styles the clock, including the layout, colors, and animations for the clock hands.
JavaScript: Calculates the current time and rotates the clock hands accordingly. It continuously updates the hands every second to ensure accurate time representation.
